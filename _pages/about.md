The Data-Centric AI Lab advances state-of-the-art artificial intelligence by rethinking the role of data. Our mission is to tackle diverse challenges in areas such as computer vision, multi-modal learning, and generative AI by exploring how data can fuel advances in AI.

From a data-centric standpoint, our research interests include data-efficient learning (self-supervised, weakly supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning), transfer learning, and synthetic data generation. We strive to advance AI systems that can learn effectively from limited or imperfect data, and to develop innovative methods that push the boundaries of what is possible through data-driven approaches.
